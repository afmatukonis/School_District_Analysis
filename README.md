# School_District_Analysis
Module 4

**Overview**


In this challenge we are tasked with reworking an existing dataset that includes a new "school budget" column.  We first collect the data from a csv file into a DataFrame, then clean up the DataFrame, sumarize it, and drill down into to find specific factors, and group certain things together. 

**Results**

After changing the grade type from object to int we were able to then perform specific analysis on the data set. We found the min reading score to be 10.5 and that it belonged to a student in grade 10 at Dixon high School, which was public. We then calculated the average math score for Green High School and found that to be 58.97. When looking at the overall reading and math scores when comparing charter versus public we saw that in the earlier grades math was higher at charter schools, and lower in public, but for the most part reading was the opposite. This could be due to public schools having a larger budget than charter schools.
